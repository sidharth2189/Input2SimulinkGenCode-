Coverage:
 
To find the code coverage of a shared library (.so file) using gcov with Robot Framework testsuite, follow these steps:
 
1. Compile the shared library with the necessary debugging flags to generate coverage data. 
For example, if your shared library is named 'my_model.so', compile it with the -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage flags:
```
gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -shared -o my_model.so -I my_model_ert_rtw/ my_model_ert_rtw/*.c
```
 
2. Run your Robot Framework testsuite that includes the tests for the shared library. Make sure to execute all relevant test cases.
 
3. After running the testsuite, navigate to the directory where the shared library is located. 
You should see some .gcda and .gcno files generated. These files contain the coverage data for your shared library.
 
4. Use the gcovr command to generate a coverage report for your shared library. For example, run:
```
gcovr --html-details MyModel.html
```
if some file needs to be excluded from coverage, this may be informed to gcovr. For example:
```
gcovr --html-details MyModel.html --exclude='my_model_ert_rtw/ert_main.c'
```

5. This will search for all your .gcno and .gcda files, run the compilerâ€™s gcov tool, and summarize the code coverage statistics into a report. 
By default, we get a text summary on the command line that shows aggregate statistics for each line.
